	- Generic command processor
	
- Joystick:
	x Check button output
	- Allow diferent quadrants so (X,Y) should be processed respect different (0, 0)

- RRLCarController:
	x Use Arduino Nano to save space
	x Extra buttons to activate features
	x Avoid unnecessary transmission
		x Calculate motor direction on Controller part and not in Car part
	- Change speed/movement in progress when SpeedMode (button) is changed
